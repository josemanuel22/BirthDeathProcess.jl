\frametitle{My Strengths and Researcher Wishes}

I want to dedicate myself to the study of computational mathematics. I wish to learn and develop new numerical and statistical methods and apply them to the simulation of physical problems.

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\item International experience, student and working abroad.
\item A double bachelor's degree in pure mathematics and computer engineering with recognized experience.
\item Experience and desire to learn about numerical simulation (worked on modelization of Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection using spectral methods) and numerical methods (finite elements, Monte-Carlos, etc.). Wish to combine the later with modern statistical tools that help me understand complex phenomena of the real world.
\item  Desire to develop open-source programs and libraries from the research we carry out. I have already contributed to open-source projects, like Julia. I think we can take advantage of the latter to develop new modern libraries.
\end{itemize}
